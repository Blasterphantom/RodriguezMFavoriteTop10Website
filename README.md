Challenge 3 - Favorite Top Ten Website

Group project to create a website with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap with a partner listing two different Top 10 Lists. In our case Marcel is doing a Top 10 Anime Characters list and Brandon is doing a Top 10 Kpop songs list. There will be 3 different pages linked together for the title (index) page, Marcel's Top 10 page, and Brandon's top 10 page. Clicking on the pictures in the carousel will take you to the corresponding text block on the page. IE: Clicking on Luffy will take you to his ranking on the Top 10 Anime Characters List, and the same for the Top 10 Kpop songs carousel.
