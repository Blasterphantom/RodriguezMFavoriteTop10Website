Challenge 3 - Favorite Top Ten Website

Group project to create a website with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap with a partner listing two different Top 10 Lists. In our case Marcel is doing a Top 10 Anime Characters list and Brandon is doing a Top 10 Kpop songs list. There will be 3 different pages linked together for the title (index) page, Marcel's Top 10 page, and Brandon's top 10 page. Clicking on the pictures in the carousel will take you to the corresponding text block on the page. IE: Clicking on Luffy will take you to his ranking on the Top 10 Anime Characters List, and the same for the Top 10 Kpop songs carousel.

Note for Brandon's Top 10 Kpop Songs page: I tried to look up different videos for the embedded youtube videos so they would show up on the page and not show as "Video Unavailable Watch on YouTube". But every video I tried kept not working and I finally realized why. Because the Kpop artists songs are also playing in the review videos, they are copyrighted and can't play when embedded, so almost every single review video won't work while embedded. I was only able to find one that worked while embedded and it was most likely because the youtuber had a really long video and the copyright didn't recognize that they had the song playing in it. But for all of the videos if you click the watch on youtube it will link you there, and I made sure to replace the videos which were blocked by the school wifi, so you could atleast click them to be redirected and watch on YouTube.
