            BLACKPINK (블랙핑크; stylized as BLΛƆKPIИK) is a four-member girl group (Rose, Jisoo, Jennie, and Lisa) formed
            by YG
            Entertainment. They debuted on August 8, 2016. "Lovesick Girls" was released on October 2, 2020, through YG
            Entertainment and Interscope Records, as the third single from the group's first Korean-language studio
            album, The

            EDM sound. Lyrically, the song deals with the pain after a heartbreak. "Lovesick Girls" peaked at number two
            on
            the Billboard Global 200 and number one on the Global Excl. U.S., becoming Blackpink's first number-one hit

            They
            debuted on August 7, 2017. They officially concluded their activities on January 27, 2019. The "Spring
            Breeze"
            video was released on November 19 along with the album, with Billboard calling the song a "smooth dance
            track that
            leans into lilting synths and alt rock instrumentals while sprinkling in orchestral strings, horns and piano
            elements to craft a stirring melody". The Korea Times labeled the song alternative dance. The video shows
            the
            group performing "clean-cut, interpretive choreography". The album was described as having songs about the
            members' feelings about the group's upcoming disbandment.</p>

            NewJeans (Korean: 뉴진스; RR: Nyujinseu) is a South Korean girl group formed by ADOR, a subsidiary of Hybe
            Corporation. The group is composed of five members: Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin, and Hyein. The group's
            name,
            NewJeans, is a double entendre. It alludes to the idea that jeans are a timeless fashion item and the
            group's
            intention to carve a timeless image for themselves. The name is also a word play on the phrase "new genes",
            referring to the group ushering a new generation of pop music. On July 23, the group's second single "Hype
            Boy"
            was released alongside a 50-second clip revealing the names of the members, further accompanied by four
            other
            music videos for the song, specific to the members' perspectives. "Hype Boy" eschews the "slow-jam
            nostalgia" of
            the preceding single "Attention" and "instead invokes contemporary reimaginations of 2000s sounds with its
            tropical touches and future bass," although "the way these elements are arranged make for a dreamy, almost
            hazy
            atmosphere."</p>

            Kim Tae-yeon (Korean: 김태연; born March 9, 1989), known mononymously as Taeyeon, is a South Korean singer. She
            debuted as a member of girl group Girls' Generation in August 2007, which went on to become one of the
            best-selling artists in South Korea and one of the most popular K-pop groups worldwide. "11:11" was released
            as a
            digital single on November 1, 2016, by SM Entertainment. The song's lyrics were penned by Kim Eana while its
            music
            was composed by Christian Vinten and Chelcee Grimes. The song was later included in the Deluxe edition of
            Taeyeon's first studio album My Voice which was released on April 5, 2017. The song is described as a pop
            ballad
            that features the acoustic guitar's calm melody which suits the late autumn atmosphere. Its lyrics are about
            a
            girl's reminiscences about making wishes with her former lover when the clock struck 11:11. Billboard ranked
            the
            song at number 7 on their top 20 K-pop songs of 2016. By the end of 2017, "11:11" sold over 1.4 million

            Lee Ji-eun (Korean: 이지은; born May 16, 1993), also known by her stage name IU (Korean: 아이유), is a South
            Korean
            singer-songwriter, record producer and actress. She signed with LOEN Entertainment (now Kakao Entertainment)
            in
            2007 as a trainee and debuted as a singer at the age of fifteen with her first extended play (EP) Lost and
            Found
            (2008). "Eight" (Korean: 에잇; eit) is a song featuring Suga, a rapper of South Korean boy band BTS. It was
            released
            as a digital single on May 6, 2020 by EDAM Entertainment. The song was written by IU, Suga, and El Capitxn
            and
            produced by Suga. Musically, "Eight" has been described as a "nostalgic" pop rock song with lyrics that find
            IU
            confessing as a twenty-eight year old, using a virtual figure and various analogies. The song received
            generally
            positive reviews from music critics, who not only praised its lyrics and production, but also compared the
            song to
            the works of musicians such as Avicii, Zedd and Alessia Cara. Commercially, the single debuted at number one
            on
            the South Korean Gaon Digital Chart. It also entered the Billboard World Digital Song Sales chart at number
            one.
            The accompanying music video for "Eight" was directed by Kim Woogie (GDW) and features IU revisiting various
            phases of her youth through her memories.</p>

            Twice (Korean: 트와이스; RR: Teuwaiseu; commonly stylized as TWICE) is a South Korean girl group formed by JYP
            Entertainment. The group is composed of nine members: Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Momo, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun,
            Chaeyoung, and Tzuyu. Twice was formed under the television program Sixteen (2015) and debuted on October
            20,
            2015. "Likey" (stylized in all caps) is a song recorded by South Korean girl group Twice. It was released by
            JYP
            Entertainment on October 30, 2017, as the lead single from their first studio album Twicetagram. The future
            electropop song opens with a synth-driven intro, and continues with children cheering, trumpeting horns, and
            old-school synthesizer samples throughout the track. Lyrically, it is about the agony of trying to elicit a
            social-media "like" from a crush, as well as the struggle of maintaining a beautiful social media image.
            "Likey"
            debuted at number 1 and 2 on the Gaon Digital Chart and the Billboard Japan Hot 100, respectively. It

            Red Velvet (Korean: 레드벨벳; romanized: Ledeubelbet;) is a South Korean girl group formed and managed by SM
            Entertainment. They originally debuted on August 1, 2014, with the single "Happiness" with the four-member
            line-up
            of Irene, Seulgi, Wendy and Joy. A fifth member, Yeri, joined the group in March 2015, following the release
            of
            their first mini album, Ice Cream Cake. Musically, the work of Red Velvet reflects their own group name:
            their
            predominantly-pop "red" side experiments occasionally with electronic and funk, and while their "velvet"
            side
            focuses on '90s-influenced R&B with elements of ballad and hip hop. Their genre versatility and hooks have
            garnered critical praise. "Psycho" received positive reviews from music critics for its "smooth and sultry"
            delivery and its "haunting", "catchy yet structured" production. Though released at the end of 2019, critics
            cited
            the single as one of the best K-pop songs of that year. The song charted at number one in Singapore and in
            North
            America, where it was the group's second number-one song on the Billboard World Digital Songs chart and tied
            them
            with 2NE1 as the girl groups with the most top-10 entries on the ranking.</p>

            BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a South Korean boy band
            formed in
            2010 and debuting in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment. The septet—consisting of members Jin, Suga, J-Hope,
            RM,
            Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own material. Originally a hip hop group,
            their
            musical style has evolved to incorporate a wide range of genres; their lyrics have often discussed mental
            health,
            the troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards self-love, and individualism.
            Their
            work also frequently references literature, philosophy and psychological concepts, and includes an alternate
            universe storyline. As of 2022, BTS is the best-selling artist in South Korean history, having sold in
            excess of
            30 million albums. "Spring Day" received universal critical acclaim from music critics, who praised its
            production, sentimental lyrics and BTS' vocal delivery. "Spring Day" received several accolades, including
            Song of
            the Year at the 2017 Melon Music Awards, and appeared on the decade-end list of best K-pop songs by
            Billboard.
            Rolling Stone named it one of the greatest boy band songs of all time. Commercially, the song was a success
            in
            South Korea debuting at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart, and it has since sold over 2.5 million copies
            in the
            country. The song also peaked at number 15 on the US Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100.</p>
