            Naruto Uzumaki is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uzumaki clan. He became the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails on
            the day of his birth — a fate that caused him to be shunned by most of Konoha throughout his childhood.
            After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgement all the while chasing
            his dream to become Hokage. In the following years, through many hardships and ordeals, he became a capable
            ninja, regarded as a hero both by the villagers, and soon after, the rest of the world, becoming known as
            the Hero of the Hidden Leaf. He soon proved to be one of the main factors in winning the Fourth Shinobi
            World War, leading him to achieve his dream and become the village's Seventh Hokage</p>

            Anteiku as a part-time waiter, he learns how to live as a ghoul and eventually becomes known as Eyepatch.
